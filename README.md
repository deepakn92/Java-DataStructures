# Java-DataStructures

This repo contains a Restaurant Queuing Simulator implemented in Java, that takes in inputs from the console window, and prints out a simulated 
restaurant queuing system on a regular day at a restaurant. This was my first major project in Java, and I learned a lot about implementing Java.Random
class and using it in my program along with Math.random to generate randomized variables in the queuing process.
